# 2.-Advanced-CSS-Challenge-Professional-Portfolio

# Purpose
This portfolio project was a chance to practice HTML and CSS skills while highlighting previous deployed application samples, and providing resume and contact details to potential employers. Employers are presented with my name, a recent photo, links to sections about me, my work, and how to get in contact with a functioning navigation bar that links to appropriate sections on the page and other deployed projects. The first project image is bigger than the second, images link to an external deployed application, and adapts to viewport size.

# Usage
1. Open the Horiseon URL in your browser.
2. Navigate the website by scrolling up and down and using the top navigation bar to shortcut to specific sections.
