# 2.-Advanced-CSS-Challenge-Professional-Portfolio

# Purpose
This portfolio project is an opportunity to practice HTML and CSS skills while highlighting previous deployed application samples, and providing resume and contact details to potential employers. Employers are presented with my name, a recent photo, links to sections about me, my work, and how to get in contact with a functioning navigation bar that links to appropriate sections on the page and other deployed projects. Specific goals include having first project image be bigger than the second, images link to an external deployed application, and adapts to viewport size.

HTML is used to markup the structure of the site and CSS to style content. Flexbox and media queries are used for mobile-responsiveness, which may be consolidated and updated to new technologies and more specific screen sizes in the future.

# Usage
1. Open the portfolio page URL in your browser.
2. Navigate the website by scrolling up and down and using the top navigation bar to shortcut to specific sections.

# Built With
* HTML
